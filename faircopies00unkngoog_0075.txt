And when men wasted health and life,
in search of rank and richeS,
Jack watched aloof the paltry atrise,
and wore his threadbare breeohes.

Ι GAZED upon the rippling stream¹
the moon was clear and bright:

across the tide a silvery boam
fell 0'er its waters white.

And life, I said, is like that stream,
which to the ocean flows3

and love is like that silvery boam
which lights it as it goes.

The moon is gone-the rippling stream
sffll hastens to the main:

Ah! love is but a transient gleam
and allis dark again.

Yon clouds that do the moon enclose,
are o’er its brightness laid3

Ah! life hath many clouds like those,

our bright hopes thus to shade.
’ Axon.
