DO confess thou’rt smooth and fair,

and 1 might have eeme near to love thee,
had I not found, the slightest prayer,

that lipe eeuld move, had power to move theet
but I ean let thee now alone,

ee worthy to be loved by none.
The morning rose that untoueh’d stands
arm’d with her briars, how eweet she emells!
but pluek'd and etrein’d through ruder hande,
her eweets no longer with her dwelle:
but erent end beeuty both are ςοιιθ,4
and leaves fall from her one by one.
Such fate ere long will thee botida,
when thou haet handled been while,
'th sere flowers to be thrown aeide,
and Ι shall eigh while some will smile‚
to see thy leve to every one
’ heth brought thee to be loved by none.
R. Arrer.
