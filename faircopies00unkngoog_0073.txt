XXVIII
JOLLY JAOK
WHEN fierce politica] debete

throughout the isle was storming,

and Rads attached the throne and state,
and Tories the reforming;

to calm the furious rege of each,
and right the land demented,

Hoeven sent us Jolly Jack, to teach
the way to be contented.

Jack's bed was stratu 'twes warm and soft,
his cheir, a three-legged stool;

his broken jug was emptied oft,
yet, somehow, always full.

His mistress' portrait decked the wall,
his mlrror ha'd e creck;

yet, gay end glad, though this was all
his wealth lived J olly J ack.

To give advice to savarico,
teaeh pride its mean condition,

end preech good sense to dull pretence,
was honest Jeck’s high mission.

Our single statesman found his rule
of moral in the flegon,

end held his philosophie school
beneath the ‘Georgo and Dragon’.

When village Solous cursed the herde,
and called the malt-tex sinful,

Jack heeded not their angry words,

but smiled and drank fl skinful.
