AS a tall ehip, t'ossed mi troublous sene,
whom raging winde threatening to make the prey
of the rough roche, do diversely disease,
meets two contrary billows by the wey,
that her on either side do sore assay,
and boast to swallow her in greedy grave3
she scorning both their spites, does make wide way,
and with her breast breaking hhe foomy nave,
does ride 011 both their baeks, and fair herself does save.
So boldly he him beare, and rushehh forth
behween them both, by conduct of hie blade.
Wondroue great prowess and heroic worth
he shewed that day, and rare ensomple made,
when two so mighty warriors he diemayod3
ationoe he warde and strikes, he takes and payS,
now forced ho yield‚ now forcing 1ο invade,
before behind and round about him lays3
eo double was his paine, so double be his praise. Ι
