to him did open, and affoorded way:

him followed eke sir Guyon evermore,

ne darknesse him, ne daunger might dismay.
Sodne oe he entred was, the dore streightway
did shut, and from behind it forth there lept
en ugly feend, more fowle then diemell day, ·
the whioh with monstrous etelhe behind him stept,
and ever as he went dew wetoh upon him kept.
Sororem.
