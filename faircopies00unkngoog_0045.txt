D. HEAR how the birds, on every blooming spray,
wilh joyous musio wake the dawning day!
why sit we mute, when early linnets sing,
when warbling Philomel salutes the spring?
why sil we sad, when Phosphor shines so clear,
and lavish nature points the purple year?

S. Sing then, and Damon shall attend the strain,
while yon slow oxen turn the furrow’d plain.
Here the bright oroous and blue violet glow;
here western winde 011 breathing rosas blow.

I’ll slake yon lamb, that near lhe fountain plays
and from the brink his danoing shade surveys.

D. And I this bowl; where wauton ivy twines
and ewelling oluslers bend the aurling vines:
four figures rising from the work appear;
the various sessons of the rolling year,
and what' is thal, whioh binds the radiant sky,
where twelve fair signs in beanleous order lie?

S. Thon sing by turns. by turns the Muses sing;
now hawlhorns blossom, now the daisies spring;
now leaves the aree, and flowers adorn the ground,
begin; the vales shall every nole rebound.

Poro.
