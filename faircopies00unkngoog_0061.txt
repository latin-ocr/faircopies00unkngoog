ND trembling Feare still to and fro did fly,
and found no place where safe he shroud him
might3
lamenting Sorrow did in darknes lye,
and Shame his ugly face did hide from living eye.
And over them sad Horror with grim hew
did always soar, beating his yron wings3
and after him owles and night-navens flew,
the hateful messengers of heavy things,
of death and dolor telling sad tidings3

whiles sad Oeleno, sitting on a elift,
a song of bale and bitter sorrow sings
that hart of flint asunder could have rifte 3
which having ended after him she flyeth swift.
