PROME'I'HEUS

E ended, and the assembly all amazed

at that unlooked·f0r sentence, in great awe
on the two sovran Brethren bent their eyes.
No whit had either moved, but on the Seer
kepd their large gaze majestie‚ fixed and fulL
Then, ee one impulse in the twein had stirred,
from both with one accord their high assent
rolled through the solemn stillness, deep and clear:
‘Se be it as thou sayest, Voiee of Fato?

Therewith in confirmation those great Gods‚

immortal and imperial, bowed their browe
Heaven stirred at that dread sign, and Earth afar

thrice rocked responsive, heaving all her sees.
