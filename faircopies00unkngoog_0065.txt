XXIV
THE VAGABOND

ΘΝΕ to me the life I love,
let the lave go by me,

give the jolly heaven above
and the byvvay nigh me.

Bed in ihe bush with stare to see,
breed I dip in the river,

there’s the life for a man like me,
there’e the life for ever.

Let the blovv fall soon or late,
let what will be 0'er me 3

give the face of earth around
and the read before me.
Wealth Ι seek not, hope nor love,
not a friend to know me;
all I eeek, the heaven above
and the read below me.

R. L. Snnvnvsov.
