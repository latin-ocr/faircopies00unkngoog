ESIDE them both, upon lhe soiled grass
the dead eorpse of an armed knig'hl was spread,
whose armour all wilh blood besprinkled was;
his ruddy lips did smile, and rosy red
did paint his oheerful oheeks, yet being dead ;
seemed lo have been a goodly personage,
now in his freshest flower of lusllhed,
fit to infiame fair ladies with love’s rege,
bul that fieree fale did orop the blossom of his age. ’
Whom when the good sir Guyon did behold,
his heart ’gan wax as hard as marble stone,
and his fresh blood did frieze wilh fearful oold,
that all his senses seemed berefl al one:
at last his mighty ghosl gan deep lo groan,
aa lion, grudging in his great disdain,
mourns inwardly and lo himself makes moan;
till ruth and frail affection did constrain
his slout oourage to bloop, and show his inward pain.
