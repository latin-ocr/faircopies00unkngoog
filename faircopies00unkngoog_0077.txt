HIGH on e throne of royal state, which far

outshon the wealth of Ormus and of Ind,
or where the gorgeous Easi with riohest hand
show’rs on her kings barbarie pearl and gold,
Satan exalted sei, by merit rnis’d
io that bad eminenoe; and from despair
thus high uplifted beyond hope, aspires
beyond ihus high, insatiate to pursue
vain war with Heav’n‚ and by suooess untaught
his proud imaginatione thus displey’d:
‘Powers and Dominions‚ Deities of Heav’n‚
for sinoe no deep within her gulf ean hold
immortal vigor, though oppresi and fall’n,
I give noi Heav’n for lost!

Musoni.
