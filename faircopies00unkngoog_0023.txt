IV Α
THE WILD HONEYSUOKLE

'FAIR flower, that dost ao eomely grew,

hid in this silent dull retreat,
, untouah’d thy honey’d bloasoms blow,

uneeen thy little branehes greet3

no roving foot shall erush thee here,

no busy hand provehe a tear.

By Nature's aelf in white arrayed,
she bade thee shun the vulgar eye,

and planted here the guardian ahade,
and sent solt waters murmuring by:

thus quietly thy summer goea

thy days deelining to repoae.

Smit with those eharms that must deeay,
I grieve to aee your future d00m;

they died-nor were those fiowers more gay,
the flowers that did in Eden bloom3

unpitying fresta and autumn's power

shall leave no vestiga of thia fiower.

P. Fallere.
