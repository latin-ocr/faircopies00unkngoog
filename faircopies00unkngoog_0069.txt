PROMETHEUS

AGAIN the Thunderer spake: ‘'Pitan, thy task
ie ended, but not ended be thy stay

among thy peers, this company of Gods.

Here is thy place prepared, here dwell content,

our oounsellor at need, our new-won friend f

Rest here at ease, and learn the unfolded hale

by all these agee wrought in Heaven and Barth,

and changeful tribes of men, thy chosen aare,

once loved by thee alone ; but now, be sure,

there is no (rod that hath not linked his name,
perehanoe his rade, do human hope and sear.

Stay then, for change by change is reeompeneed‚
and new things now wax old, and old are new?

Ε. Meros.
