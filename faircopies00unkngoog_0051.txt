XVII

SEE what delights in silvan soenes appear!
deseending gods have found Elysium here.

In woods bright Venus with Adonis stray’d,

And ahaste Diana haunts the forest shade.

Come, lovely nymph, and bless the silent hours,

when swains from shearing seelr their nightly bowers;

when weary reapers quit the sultry field,

and orown’d with oorn, their thanks to Oaros yield.

This harmless grove no lurking viper hides,

but in my breast the serpent love abides.

Here bees from blossoms sip the rosy dew,

but your Alexis knows no sweets but you.

Ο deign to visit our lorsaken seats,

the moss'y fountains, and the green retreatsl

where'er you walk, oool gales shall fan the glade;

trees, where you sit, shall crowd into a shade;

where’er you troad, the blushing flowers shall rise,

and all things flourish where you turn your eyes.

Porn.
