ODE ΟΝ Α HAMPSHIRE VILLAGE

ΗΞ mourn thy loved retreat! no 111010 -
shall olassio steps thy 000110 exploro!
when morn’s pale rays but faintly peep
o’er yonder oak·orown’d airy 01000,
who now shall olimb ile browe‚ 10 view
thy length 01 landsoapee ever new:
where summer flinge in oareless pride,
her varied veeture far and wide!
Who mark beneath each village-oharm,
, 01 grange or olm-enoiroled farm:
the flinty dove-oole’s crowded 1001,
watoh’d by the 11110 thet aeile aloof ;
1110 11111011 pines, whose umbrage tall
darkens 1110 longdeserted hall:
1110 vel’ran beeoh, thalon 1110 plain
0011001011 eve 1110 playful train:
the 00111101 smokes with early fire,

1110 low-roof’d fane’s embosom'd spire!
