IX
PROMETHEUS

ΟΝ his immortal brow,
ploughed by strange pangs, anguish unknown in Hoeven,
dwelt weightier thought than theirs, more arduous love.
With one aooord the congregated Gods

, in sudden homage from their golden thrones
rose up for reuerent greeting‚ as he oame.
Thon, as he gained their midai, the Thunderer spake:

‘Hail, wondrous Titan, Earth's mysterious son,

prophet Prometheus! In this hour of need
weloomethou art returned among the Gods,
thyself a God: assume thy place, sit there
aoknowledged arbiter: what present doubt
distracta our raoe divine thou knowest well
already, and already know'st uo less <
the doom ravealed that must that doubt dissolve.
Judge then, for all the Powors of Hoaven are here

expectant, and await thy final word'
· E. Mrnas.
