56
Ι think Nature hath lost the mould
where she her ehape did take3
or else I doubt if Nature oould
so fair a creature make.
She may be well compared
unto the Phoenix kind,
whose like was never seen or heard,
that any man ean find.
In life she is Diana chaale,
in truth Penelope;
in word and eke in deed stedfaet3
what will you more we say?
If all the world were sought so far,
who could find such a wight?
Her beauty twinkleth like astar
within the frosty night.
At Baoohua’ feast none shall her meet,
· ne at no wanton play,
nor gazing in an open street,
nor gadding as a stray.
The modest mirth that she doth use
is 'mixed with ahamefaslnesa3
all vioe she deth wholly refuso,
and haiath idleness.
