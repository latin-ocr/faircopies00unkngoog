V
LOVE AND Asu

Ι PLAY’D with you 'mid oowslips blowing,
when I was six and you were four; ·
when garlands wearing, flower·balls throwing‚
were pleasures soon to please no more.
Thro’ groves and meads, o’er grass and heather,
with little playmates, to and ⁵iro,
we wander’d hand in hand together3
but that was sixty years ago.
You grew a lovely roseata maiden,
and still our early love was strong;
still with no care our days were laden,
they glided joyously along;
and 1 did love you very dearly,
how dearly words want power to show3
Ι thought your heart was touched as nearly;
but that was fifty years ago.
Then other lovers came arouud you,
your beauty grew from year to year,
and many a splendid eirole found you
the centro of its glittering sphere;
I saw you then, first vows forsaking,
on rank and wealth your hand bestow,

0, then, 1 thought my heart was breaking,
but that was forty years ago.

And Ι lived on, to wed another3
no cause she gave me to repine;

and when 1 heard you were a mother,

I did not wish the ohildren mine.
