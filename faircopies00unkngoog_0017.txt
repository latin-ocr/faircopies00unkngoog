ΗΕΒΕ never was a fortnight that epun iteelf away,
so feet as yonre in England, whieh ended yesterday;
we oould not stay your parting, though each did all he
'knew,
and now we fill the void, deor, with memories of you.
It seemed to be our birthright-we used it with a zest- '
to set to work at guessing, when pretty Martha guessed,
and when we marked with rupture her voiee's riso
and fall,
we aimed at epeeoh like Martha’e, and missod it, one
and all.
And now yon’re on the sea, deor, while1am on the
land3
I cannot see your glandes, 1 cannot grasp your hand,
’ ¹ and, oh, the waves that toss yon, they cannot injure me,
since I am on the land, deer, and you ere on the sea.
YeS, now old Neptune sways you„ You do not like
him much,
he adds to look of humour too boisterous a touoh.
You cannot wheedle him, deor, as once you wheedled me,
who linger here lamenting, while you are on the eea.
