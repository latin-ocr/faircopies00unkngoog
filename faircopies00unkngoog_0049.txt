ΑΡΟΟΤ,

ONG ie the rond ’twixt town and town thot runs,
travelled by many a lordly oavaloade,
with treppings gay, and rieh caparisone,

jester and equire, and laughing knight and moid:
with gellani olash and stir they go their way;
Ι trudge afoot through anthe drouth of day.
Ferme the mistymeadows fresh with morn,
the tremp through noontide heat to eveninggrey,
the far-seen smoke from the day’s goel upborne‚
the halt the friendly greeting by the way,
the distant hill behind far hill desoried,
the road by day, the rest by eventide.
I know each wayside wood, eaoh moorland brown‚
each hidden byway and reposeful nook,
where I may linger when the sun goes down,
dipping tired feet in some oool flowing brook:
Ι know the free hill and the glooming glen,
and kindly fimo, and humble homes of men.
O. Fox Sn1n1r.
