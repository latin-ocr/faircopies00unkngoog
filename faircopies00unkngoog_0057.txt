GA‘I'HER me the rose, the rose,
while yeb in flower we find it,
for summer smiles, but summer goes,
and winter waits behind it.
For with the dream forgone, forgone, ,
the deed sorborne for ever,
the worm Regret will canker 011,
and Time will turn him never. ἣ
So well it were to love, my love,⁸

and cheat of any laughter
the fate beneath us and above,

the dark before and after.
The myrtle and the rose, the rose,
the sunshine and the ewallow, χ
the dream that comm, the wish that goes,
the memoriee that follow!

W. E. Hmm.
