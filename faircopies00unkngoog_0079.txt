XXXI
MR. W. HERVEY

Y sweet companion, and my gentle peer,
why hest thou left me thus unkindly here,
thy end for ever, and my life, to moen:
0 thou hest left me all alone!
Thy soul and body, when deaihâ€™s agony
besieged around thy noble heard,

did nob with more reluctanee part
than I, my deerest friend, do part from thee.
Ye fields of Cambridge, our dear Cambridge, say,

have ye not seen us walking every day?

was there e tree about whieh did nob know
the love betwixb us two?

Heneeforth, ye gentle trees, for ever fade,
or your sad branehes thieker join,
and into darksome ehades combine,

dark as the greve wherein my friend is leid.

A. Gownrr.
