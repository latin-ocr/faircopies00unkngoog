OH! 'tis little Msry Cassidy's the oense of all my

mlfflfys
the raison that I am not nowthe boyI used to be;
Oshe batos the besuties all that we read about in
history,
sure half the country-side's as lost for her as me.
Travel Ireland up and down, hill, village, vale, and town,
girl like my ‘osilin donn' you’ll he looking for in
vam:
ohl I'd rather live in poverty with little Mary
Cassidy‚
than Emperor without her be, o’er Germany or ·
Spain.
'Twes at the donee stDarmody's that first I caughta sight
of her,

and heard her sing an Irish song, till tears oame in ,

my eyes:
and ever since that blessed honr I’m dreaming day and
night oi her,
the divil a wink of sleep I get from bed to riso.
Her oheek the rose of June, her song the lark in tune3
working, resting‚ night or noon, she never laves my
mind:
ohl till singing by my rabin-fine sits little Mary
Oassffly,
’tis little eise or happiness I'm sure I’ll ever find.
F. A. I’m.
