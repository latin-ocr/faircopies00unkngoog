XXXII
WIN'I'ER NIGHTS

OW winter nights enlarge the number of their
h rs·
and eloude iiieir' storms discharge up'on the airy howers.
Lot now the ohimneys blaze end eups o’orflow with
w e· ⁴
let well-tuinediwords amez'e with harmony divine!
now yellow wexen lights shall weit on honey love,

while youthful mesques and oourily eighis eleep’s spello
remove. “

This time doth well dispenso with lover’s long discourse ;
muoh speech hath some hosomo, though beauty no

remorso.
All do not all things well:
some measures oomely troad,
some knotted riddles tell,
some poems smoothly read.
The summer hath his joys‚
and winter hie delights3
though love and all his pleasures are but hoyo,
they shorten tedious nights.
