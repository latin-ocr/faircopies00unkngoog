XXIII
SONG

ROM the court to the eottoge eonvey me away,
for I’m weary of grandeur and whet they eall· gay:
where pride without measure,
end pomp without pleasure‚
make life in e eirole of hurry deoay.
Far remote end retir'd from the noire of the town,
I’ll exehenge my brooede for e plain rueeet gown,
my friends shall be few,
but well-chosen and true,
end sweet reereetion our evening shall orown.
With e rnrul repert, e rioh banquet for me,
on a moeey green turf, near some ehady old tree,
the river's clear brink
shall efford me my drink,
end Temp’rance my friendly phyeieion ehell be.
Ever culm and serene, with eontentment etill bloet,
not too giddy with joy, or with sorrow depreetz
I'll neither invoke
or repine at death’e stroke,
but retire from the world ee I would to my rest.

H. omer.
