A DIRGE

SLEEP, sleep, poor youth ; slesp, sleep in penos,
rsliev’d from love, aud mortal ωας
whilsb we, that pins in love's diseno,
uncertain bles& less happy m.
eoueh’d in tho ‹im-k and silent grave,
no ius of fahs thou now canet ἕως
in vain would tyn-ant power enslave,
or soomful benuty be severe.
an that do fistal etot-ms disperse,
fu· hom thy happy marmiun keep;
euthquee that shake the universe,
onn’t took thee into eounder sleep.
With ιι] the ohanne of pem possess,
seeum from life’s torm-mont, pain,
deep, and indulge thy sslf with teet,
nor dream thou o'er ahnlt riso again.

D'Umunr.
