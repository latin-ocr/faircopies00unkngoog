PROMETHEUS

OW through the royel hall, for Heaven’e dread Lord
wrought by the Firehing's hand, the assembled
upon tffgchsr'orn appointed, thronging renged

expectaut3 mute they moved, aud took their thrones, “
gloom on their brows, though Gods; so dark the dread
of huge impendiug battle held their hearts, '

battle of brother Kings, Heeven and the Sea
in duel dire, convulsive war of worlds.

So mused they all, and highest throned the Sire,
Lord of the lightning; on one side his Queen,
on the other, not less nigh, his ohosen ohild
Pallas, most deor of all his raoe divine.
Somewhet aloof, yet in the upper hall,
the King Poseidon sate, and round his throne
Ooeen, undull great Rivers of the world,
and all See-powers, and hoory Nereus nigh,

Nereus the ancient prophet, Thetis' sire.
