S fearfull fowle, thar long in secret eave

for dread of soring hauke herself heth hid,
not earing how, her silly life io eave,
she her gay painted plumes disorderid ; ,
eeeing et last herselfe from daunger rid,
peeps foorth end soon renewes her native pride:
she gius her feathers fowle disfigured
prowdly to prune, and eett on every eide3

so shakes off shame, ne thinks how eret she did her
hide.

So when her goodly visage h'e beheld,
he gan himselfe to vount, but when he vowed
those deadly tooleS, which in her hand she held,

till she to him her graiioue speaoh renewed:
‘All heile, sir knighi, and well moy thee befall',
ee anthe like, which honour hove persewed
through deeds of armes and prowesse martial,
all virtue merite praiee, bui suoh the moed of all?
