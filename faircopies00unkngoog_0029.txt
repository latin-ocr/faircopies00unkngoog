VI

WHATE’ER the passion-knowledge, fame, or pelf,
not one will ohonge his neighbour with himself.

The learn’d 18 happy nature to explere,
the fool 18 happy that he knows no more,
the rieh 18 happy in the plenty giv'n,
the poor contente him with the oare of heev’n.
See the blind begger donee, the eripple sing,
the sot 8 hero, lunatio 8 king;
the starving ehemiet in hie golden views
supremely blest, the poet in his muse.

’ See some strange comfort ev’ry state attend,
and pride bestow’d on 811, 8 eommon friend:
see some fit passion ev’ry age supply,
hope travels through, nor quite us when we die.
Behold the child, by nature's kindly law,
pleae’d with 8 rettle, tiekled with 8 etraw;
some livelier plaything gives hie youth delight,
8 little londer, but 88 empty quitor
searfs gartere gold amuse hie riper etaget
and beade and pray’r books are the toys of age:

ι pleas'd with this bauble still, 88 that before ;
till tir'd he eleeps, end life’e poor play 18 0’er.
Pori.
