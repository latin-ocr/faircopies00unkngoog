My own young flook‚ in fair progression‚
made up a pleasant Christmas row:

my joy in them was past expression3
but that was thirty years ago.

You grew a matron plump and oomely‚
you dwelt in fashion’s brightest blaze;

my sarahly lot was far mors homely;
but I too had my festal days.

No marrier eyes have ever glisten’d
around the hearth-stone’s wintry glow,

than when my youngest child was christen'd:
but that was twenty years age.

Time passed, my oldest girl was married,
and I am now a grandsirs gray:

one pet of four years old I've carried, '
among the wild·flower’d msads to play.

In our old fields of ahildish pleasure,
where now, as then, the oowslips blow,

she fills her basket’s ample measure,
and that is not ten years ago.

Pauooou.
